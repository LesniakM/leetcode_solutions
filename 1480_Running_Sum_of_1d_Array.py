https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/
Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

Result:
Runtime: 43 ms, faster than 89.83% of Python3 online submissions for Running Sum of 1d Array.
Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 71.01% of Python3 online submissions for Running Sum of 1d Array.
